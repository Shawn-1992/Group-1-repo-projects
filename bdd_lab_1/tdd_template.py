# This file will allow you to create a simple program following a TDD framework.
# Resources on Pytest, Typing, and Unittest.mock libraries
# are located in the documentation.

# Below, you will create a minium of five instances of a failing test and then
# implement the minimum amount of production code to pass the test before refactoring.

# The step-by-step process is outlined for you. Examples below are for
# you to alter in creating a program of similar purpose to the sample_tdd.
