# TDD Lab: Introduction to Test-driven Development

## Lab Overview
Welcome to the TDD Lab! In this lab, you will learn how to create more logical code by first testing. Test-driven development focuses on breaking programs into compact, manageable, and scalable pieces by building functionality from failing tests.
By the end of this lab, you will know how to use the TDD methodology to aid in software problem-solving and planning processes.
