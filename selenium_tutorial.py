#This is just a simple web application built with Flask.
#You will have to install Flask to run this code. 
#The /search route: This route just displays a message about searching. You can use this to demonstrate URL parameters and query strings in your Selenium tutorial.

#The /search/results/<query> route: This route takes a query parameter from the URL and displays the search results. This can be used to illustrate how to handle dynamic data in web pages.

#The /form route: This route renders an HTML form and handles both GET and POST requests. It's used to show how to interact with forms on web pages. 
#To make this work, you'll need to create an HTML template for the form (e.g., form.html) and store it in a folder named templates in the same directory as your Flask application.

#IDEAS FOR SELENIUM TUTORIAL LAB
    #Web Page Navigation:
        #Use Selenium to navigate to different routes within the Flask application, such as the root URL, the search page, and the form page.

    #Form Interaction:
        #Demonstrate how Selenium can interact with HTML forms. Fill out the form fields and submit the form using Selenium automation.

    #Element Identification:
        #Show how to locate and interact with specific HTML elements on a web page, such as input fields, buttons, and links.

    #Text Extraction and Validation:
        #Use Selenium to extract text content from web pages and validate that the content matches expectations. For example, you can use Selenium to confirm that a specific message or result is displayed after form submission.

    #Dynamic Content Handling:
        #Showcase how Selenium can handle dynamic content and elements on web pages. For example, when you pass a dynamic query to a search results page, demonstrate how Selenium can locate and validate results based on the query parameter.

    #Page Interaction and Navigation:
        #Illustrate how Selenium can perform interactions with web pages, such as clicking links, buttons, or navigation between pages.

    #Implicit and Explicit Waits:
        #Explain the concept of waiting in Selenium and demonstrate the use of implicit and explicit waits to handle elements that may take time to load or become interactive.

    #Taking Screenshots:
        #Use Selenium to take screenshots of web pages at specific points during automation, which can be useful for debugging and reporting.

    #Handling Pop-up Windows:
        #If your application includes pop-up windows or dialogs, show how Selenium can handle them effectively.

    #Testing Scenarios:
        #Create test scenarios that involve multiple interactions and verifications. For example, a test scenario might involve navigating to a search page, performing a search, and validating search results.

    #Browser Management:
        #Showcase how Selenium can manage browsers, open multiple browser instances, or control browser settings.

    #Cross-Browser Testing:
        #If applicable, demonstrate how Selenium can be used for cross-browser testing by running the same tests on different web browsers.
