# Behavior Driven Development (BDD)
# Lab Overview

In this lab, we'll have fun exploring Behavior Driven Development (BDD) with a basic calculator example. 
BDD is like teamwork for software it brings everyone together, even those who aren't into programming, 
to make sure our software does exactly what we want. We will also Learn a simple language called Gherkin to describe,
what we want our calculator to do.
