# Understanding Various Software Testing Techniques Using Python

## Project Overview

The following project utilizes an **Agile** approach to software testing and development. This project will serve those without technical expertise to better understand the tools and processes necessary for software quality assurance. The project aims to demonstrate how to properly operate platforms such as **Selenium** and **Postman**. The project will also implement behavior-driven (**BDD**) software development frameworks like **Behave**. Expect to find information and resources on web application testing. Labs are designed and centered around the following:

<br>**BDD**: Behavior-Driven Development
<br>**TDD**: Test-Driven Development
<br>**API**: Application Programming Interface
<br>**CI/CD**: Continuous Integration and Development

### Team 1 Members:
- Kristina Markina - Lead 
- Chase Davis - BDD
- Shawn Palmer - Selenium & DevOps
- Deandre Scott - BDD
- Marvelle Carter - Tester
- Noah Garner - TDD
- Dawson Pridgen - API

## Features

* Interactive labs for learning software tools and techniques.
